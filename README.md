# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

1. R Project: R package densityEst

I have produced an R package that estimates a time series of density functions using logspline approach. You can install the development version from Github

#install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ThilakshaSilva/densityEst")


2. Kaggle Competition Machine Learning Project: Predicting Titanic Survival using Five Algorithms

I have participated in a Kaggle Competition 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster' (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This real-world classification problem helped me to greatly practice some predictive modelling techniques. In this project I explored five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (both linear and non-linear), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

With this exploration, I have acquired a great deal of knowledge about Machine Learning algorithms and their pros and cons. Also, I have developed skills on handling missing data, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis.


3. Kaggle Competition Machine Learning Project: Bike Sharing Demand

In this Kaggle Challenge 'Bike Sharing Demand' (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) I employed three machine learning techniques - Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest Regression - to forecast the bike rental demand. I have also developed skills on feature engineering and exploratory data analysis.


4. Machine Learning Project: Create a Word Cloud

In this project I practiced the Natural Language Processing machine learning technique. After creating a Twitter App, I performed text manipulation and twitter mining to create a word cloud.


5. Capstone Project: MoneyBall

I helped the 'Oakland A Baseball Team' to recruit three under-valued players to replace three lost players. Employed data mining tools (including feature engineering and data wrangling) to derive actionable insights!


6. Data Visualisation Project

I used R package ggplot2 to recreate a plot from The Economist (https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/12/corruption-and-development).
