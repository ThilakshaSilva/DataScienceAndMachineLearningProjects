# Machine Learning Project: Predicting Titanic Survival using Five Algorithms

This real world classification problem helped me to greatly practice some predictive analytics techniques. In this project I explored five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (both linear and non-linear), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

With this exploration, I have acquired a great deal of knowledge about Machine Learning algorithms and their pros and cons. Also, I have developed skills on handling missing data, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis.
