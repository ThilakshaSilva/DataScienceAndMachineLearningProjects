# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

1. R Project: R package densityEst

I have produced an R package that estimates a time series of density functions using logspline approach. You can install the development version from Github

#install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ThilakshaSilva/densityEst")


2. Kaggle Competition Project: Predicting Titanic Survival using Five Algorithms

I have participated in a Kaggle Competition 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster' (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This real world classification problem helped me to greatly practice some predictive analytics techniques. In this project I explored five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (both linear and non-linear), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

With this exploration, I have acquired a great deal of knowledge about Machine Learning algorithms and their pros and cons. Also, I have developed skills on handling missing data, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis.


3. Kaggle Competition Project: Bike Sharing Demand




4. Capstone Project: MoneyBall

In this project I helped the 'Oakland A Baseball Team' to recruit three under-valued players to replace three lost players. I used my R skills to dig in data mining (including feature engineering, data merging and data analysis) to derive actionable insights!
